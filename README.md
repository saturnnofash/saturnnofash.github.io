Steps on how to create GitHub page:
1. First create a new public repository name username.gihub.io
2. Then, we need to clone the repository.
3. After that you may edit what you want your page to show by creating an HTML file.
My key takeaways:
1. I learned that I am interested in designing websites.
2. It is important to put the css and html file in the same directory.
3. Committing after every major edit is important, because it is like a checkpoint.
